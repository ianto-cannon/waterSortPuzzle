Input the colours as numbers in the array initVials using the following:
0=empty 1=darkBlue 2=darkGreen 3=lightBlue 4=purple 5=pink 
6=lightGreen 7=grey 8=orange 9=red 10=yellow 11=turquoise 12=brown.
Each row in the array is a vial. [0,0,0,0] is an empty vial.
The first element of the row is the topmost colour in the vial.

Run the code by entering "python sort.py" into your terminal.
After a series of random pours, this code will output a sequence of 
"donor vials" and "receiver vials" that completes the level.
